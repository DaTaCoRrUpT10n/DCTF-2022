although the traditional keyword method for creating a mixed substitution alphabet is simple a serious disadvantage is that the last letters of the alphabet which are mostly low frequency tend to stay at the end a stronger way of constructing a mixed alphabet is to generate the substitution alphabet completely randomly although the number of possible substitution alphabets is very large this cipher is not very strong and just easily broken provided the message is of reasonable length see below the cryptanalyst can deduce the probable meaning of the most common symbols by analyzing the frequency distribution of the ciphertext this allows formation of partial words which can be tentatively filled in progressively expanding the partial solution see frequency analysis for a demonstration of this in some cases underlying words can also be determined from the pattern of their letters for example attract osseous and words with those two as the root are the only common english words with the pattern abbcadb many people solve such ciphers for recreation as with cryptogram puzzles in the newspaper according to the unicity distance of english letters of ciphertext are required to crack a mixed alphabet simple substitution in practice typically about letters are needed although some messages can be broken with fewer if unusual patterns are found in other cases the plaintext can be contrived to have a nearly flat frequency distribution and much longer plaintexts will then be required by the cryptanalyst          dctf oneinamillionchance
